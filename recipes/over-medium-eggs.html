                <h1>Over Medium Eggs</h1>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Sunny-side-up eggs and over-easy eggs seem to get all the attention, but in recent years, the often-overlooked over-medium egg has become my number one. Sure, a runny egg is fun to look at in photos, but a jammy yolk is where it's at when it comes to enjoying it. Just like I prefer jammy boiled eggs to hard-boiled, I've taken to enjoying my fried eggs over-medium, where the yolks are cooked to just barely runny, but still soft. </p>
                <p>Somewhere between an over-easy and an over-well egg, an over-medium egg has a firmer yolk than a runny over-easy egg, but not quite as firm of a yolk as an over-well egg, which is similar to a hard-boiled egg yolk. It's the perfect balance â€” a yolk that is just barely runny, but still soft and brightly colored. It's like the fried egg version of a jammy soft-boiled egg. </p>

                    <h5>Steps</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the pan. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in an 8 or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Tilt the pan to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
                        <li>Add the eggs. Crack 2 large eggs into opposite sides of the skillet. Season with a pinch of kosher or flaky salt and a grind of freshly ground black pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the eggs cook undisturbed until the whites are mostly opaque and set except for the 1/2-inch area around the yolks, about 2 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Flip the eggs. Use the edge of a flat spatula to cut and separate the eggs from each other if needed. Gently slide the spatula under one of the eggs, making sure it is centered under the yolk, and carefully flip the egg. Flip the second egg. Season the eggs with another pinch of kosher salt and another grind of pepper.</li>
                        <li>Finish cooking the eggs. Continue to cook until the whites are completely set and the yolks are jammy, about 2 minutes more. Gently slide the eggs onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
